Basic Data Visualization using ggplot2 and transformation using dplyr (R programming language)

This visualization is a datacamp practise project. However, the data provided in this project are provided by the 
Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering who created a publicly available data repository 
to consolidate this data from sources like the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the 
Ministry of Health from multiple countries. The data used in this visualization are in the datasets folder.
